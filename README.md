We want to analyse the data related to the median value of houses in boston using deep neural networks . The dataset has been imported from kaggle and it contains a total of 10 features in addition to the targeted value of median housing value MEDV.

The objectif is to classify our housing dataset based on all the feature to predict what is the category of median value we can get. Either its lower than the overall median of the sampled data or it's in the higher rank.

This study will help us to provide the best factors that lead to the decision in term of values and before that, to identify what is the best model that can used.

In the current project we will proceed by conducting a simple preliminary EDA of our dataset, folowed by feature engineering. We will follow up with summary training by using train test splits

We will then apply our deep neural network by using multiple optimisers and different epochs to see how it performs

All the presented and discussed results will be used to formalise our final recomendations
